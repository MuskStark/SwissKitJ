/**
 * SSE-agnostic callback interface that receives the lifecycle events of a single
 * Plan-and-Execute {@link AgentRun} driven by {@link AgentRunner}.
 *
 * <p>This interface exists primarily to make {@link AgentRunner} testable without an
 * SSE/HTTP transport: a unit test supplies a recording implementation, drives a run with
 * scripted planning + tools, and asserts on the sequence of callbacks. In production the
 * controller (Task 16) wires an SSE-backed sink that forwards each event to the client as
 * a {@code text/event-stream} chunk.
 *
 * <p>Implementations <em>must</em> be safe to call from the runner's virtual thread; they
 * should not block (the runner emits {@link #onPlanToken(String)} token-by-token, and any
 * slow work in a sink would stall the whole orchestration).
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle events, in their canonical happy-path order, are:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #onPlanToken} — zero or more times while the plan is being generated.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onPlanReady} — once, when the {@link AgentPlan} is finalized.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onPlanApprovalRequested} — only when plan approval is required.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onStepStart} — once per executed step, before the tool runs.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onStepRetry} — zero or more times after a retry-safe attempt fails and
 *       before the next attempt's backoff.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onStepApprovalRequested} — only for steps flagged
 *       {@link AgentStep#requiresApproval()} under an approval-requiring config.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onStepComplete} — once per executed step, with the tool's result text.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onStepSkipped} — once per step omitted by control flow ({@code runWhen}
 *       unsatisfied or every dependency skipped); default no-op for sinks that
 *       predate branch execution.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onComplete} — exactly once on success, OR</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onError} — exactly once on terminal failure.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Exactly one of {@link #onComplete} / {@link #onError} terminates the run.
