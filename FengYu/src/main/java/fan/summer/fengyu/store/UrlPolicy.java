/**
 * Shared outbound URL policy for remote artifact sources (design §13.1 SSRF
 * row): HTTPS everywhere except a loopback host (local development), and no
 * host may resolve into a private, link-local or otherwise non-routable
 * address. Used by the store client, the skill marketplace, and the plugin
 * package downloader so the surfaces can never drift apart.
 *
 * <p><b>DNS rebinding — honest residual risk (P2-11).</b> This check resolves
 * the host itself and validates <em>every</em> address returned by
 * {@code getAllByName}, but {@code java.net.http.HttpClient} performs its own
 * independent resolution at connect time, and the standard library offers no
 * supported way to pin the pre-validated IP while preserving SNI/Host (no
 * custom-connect/SocketChannel hook exists on {@code HttpClient.Builder} in
 * current JDKs; the only workarounds — a local pinning SOCKS relay or speaking
 * HTTP by hand over a pre-connected socket — would re-implement TLS). A
 * zero-TTL rebinding domain can therefore pass validation and connect to a
 * different address milliseconds later. Mitigations that ARE in place:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>all resolved addresses are validated, so the attack requires the second
 *       answer itself to be rebindable mid-flight;</li>
 *   <li>callers invoke {@link #requireTraversable} immediately before sending
 *       (per request, not per host session), shrinking the window;</li>
 *   <li>every client using this policy keeps the {@code HttpClient} default of
 *       NEVER following redirects, so a redirect cannot re-enter resolution
 *       around the check.</li>
 * </ul>
