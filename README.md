**Infinia** (蜂语 / FengYu) is an *AI-native orchestration platform*. A plan-and-execute Agent
turns natural-language goals into multi-step business workflows by orchestrating three extension
surfaces — `.fyp` plugins, `.fys` skills, and in-process AI tools. It runs as a headless Spring Boot
backend, a Vue 3.5 + Vuetify 3 UI, and an optional Electron desktop shell; built-in tools (Excel
splitting, email, markdown, and more) ship as official plugins the Agent can call.

> ### 4.0.0 — web + desktop
> This branch (`4.0.0`) re-architects Infinia from a JavaFX desktop app into a **web +
> desktop application**: a **headless Spring Boot backend** (loopback web server, no window), a
> **Vue 3.5 + TypeScript** frontend (identical for browser and desktop), and an **Electron 43.x**
> desktop shell that sidecar-launches the Java backend. Built-in tools become official plugins that
> expose a JSON-RPC worker backend plus a micro-frontend UI bundle. JavaFX has been removed.
> See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and the [online docs](https://muskstark.github.io/FengYu/) for the current state.
>
> Run the backend: `java -jar FengYu/target/FengYu-*.jar --token=<t>` (binds port 24056 by default)
> · frontend: `cd frontend && yarn run dev` · smoke test: `scripts/e2e-smoke.sh`.
>
> The official **Email Center** plugin now ships as `fan.summer.email`: six sandboxed UI tabs,
> multi-account SMTP/IMAP, manual-only collection, encrypted credentials, and nine confirmation-first AI tools.
> See [Email Center](docs/en/plugins/email-center.md) and the [plugin database standard](docs/en/plugins/database.md).
>
> **Skills** — Codex-style progressive disclosure: enabled skills appear as a compact catalog in
> the system prompt, and the assistant loads a skill's full body on demand via the built-in
> `skill` tool. Skills are managed as `.fys` packages alongside plugins — both live on the
> **Plugins** page (`/plugins`), with a single Upload button accepting `.fyp` and `.fys`.
> See [Skills](docs/en/skills/).

## Quick Start

**Requirements:**

- **JDK 21 or higher** (recommended: [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/))
- **Node 24.18.0 and Yarn 4 via corepack** — every JavaScript area of the repo (frontend,
  desktop shell, docs site, plugin toolchain, official plugins) installs with Yarn 4, pinned per
  package through the `packageManager` field. Run `corepack enable` once; Node ≥25 drops bundled
  corepack, so install it standalone there: `npm install -g corepack`.

### Build from Source

Build the backend module through the repository Maven wrapper:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MuskStark/FengYu.git
cd FengYu

# 1. Build the backend fat JAR
./mvnw clean package -f FengYu/pom.xml -DskipTests

# 2. Run the headless backend (loopback web server on 127.0.0.1:24056)
java -jar FengYu/target/FengYu-*.jar --token=<your-token>
```

### Run the Frontend (dev)

```bash
corepack enable                             # once per machine: activates the pinned Yarn 4
cd frontend && yarn install && yarn run dev  # Vite proxies /api + /plugin-runtime to :24056
```

### Run the Desktop Shell (dev)

```bash
cd desktop/electron && yarn install && yarn run dev # set FENGYU_JAR or run the backend on :24056
# release: cd desktop/electron && yarn run build
```

### Smoke Test

`scripts/e2e-smoke.sh` boots the jar and probes every endpoint.

### Releases

Pushed release tags (`v4.0.0`, `v4.0.0-beta.*`, `v4.0.0-rc.*`) trigger
[`.github/workflows/fengyu-release.yml`](.github/workflows/fengyu-release.yml), which publishes:

- **Unsigned Electron packages** for Windows, macOS, and Linux — two variants per platform: a
  lightweight build (needs Java 21+ on PATH) and a self-contained build that bundles a jlink-minimized
  JRE. The Electron shell ships with a tray, file logging, and an auto-updater (GitHub Releases).
- A **portable Web distribution** (`Infinia-<version>-web.zip` / `.tar.gz`) — unzip and run `./run.sh`
  (macOS/Linux) or `run.bat` (Windows). Requires **Java 21**; the backend binds **loopback only**
  (`127.0.0.1`) and is not reachable from other machines.

These builds are currently unsigned; code-signing is deferred to a later release.

## Features

- **🤖 AI Agent (the spine)** — A plan-and-execute Agent decomposes a goal into steps and orchestrates the surfaces below. Sensitive actions require your approval. Multi-backend (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek) with streaming, thinking cards, tool calls, automatic long-conversation compaction, and read-only `web_search` / `web_fetch`. See [AI Agent](docs/en/guide/ai-agent) / [AI Chat](docs/en/guide/ai-chat).
- **🔀 Reusable workflows** — Build visual DAGs on the dedicated Flows canvas, bind downstream fields to workflow inputs or an upstream node's effective inputs/results, recover local drafts, run manually, or publish as dynamically discovered AI tools. The docked AI assistant can inspect and diagnose the live canvas or propose a complete new/edited graph; proposals show a diff and require explicit apply-and-save confirmation. Manual and AI paths share the same runner, approvals, SSE events, durable history, and reviewable restart recovery. See [Flow Nodes](docs/en/guide/flow-nodes).
- **🧩 Plugins (`.fyp`)** — Signed, integrity-checked packages with a sandboxed micro-frontend and
  an isolated Java, Python, or Go JSON-RPC Worker. Updates are health-gated and rollback-safe;
  runtime faults/backoff/resource limits are observable. All three worker scaffolds generate the
  full manifest and typed UI bindings from a short base plus a code-owned contract. See [Marketplace](docs/en/plugins/marketplace).
- **📜 Skills (`.fys`)** — Progressive-disclosure domain knowledge and procedures the Agent loads on demand. See [Skills](docs/en/skills/).
- **📊 Excel Splitter** — Split workbooks by sheet, column value, or complex rules — an official plugin with six AI tools. See [Excel](docs/en/plugins/official-excel).
- **📧 Email Center** — Multi-account SMTP/IMAP, contact/tag management, filename-tag batch sending, manual archive collection, and nine confirmation-first AI tools. See [Email Center](docs/en/plugins/email-center.md).
- **📝 Markdown Editor** — Split-pane editor with isolated server-side rendering. See [Markdown](docs/en/plugins/official-markdown).
- **📦 Offline Python Builder** — Build air-gap-ready Python wheelhouses (full dependency resolution via `pip download`) as an async job, with verify and deploy. See [Offline Python](docs/en/plugins/official-offlinepython).
- **🌐 Browser Agent** — A **built-in** (host-embedded, not a plugin) capability that drives real browser tabs through Electron's native engine — no separate Chromium/Playwright download. Twenty-five effect-classified AI tools cover isolated contexts, stateful tabs, per-tab stable refs, history, hover/scroll/select interaction, page-level keys, multimodal PNG screenshots, batching, and eval JS. **Desktop-only** (requires the Electron shell). See [Browser Capability](docs/en/plugins/official-browser.md).
- **🖥️ Computer Use** — ChatGPT-desktop-style screen control, built into desktop builds: the AI captures the real screen (vision-ready PNGs), then moves the mouse, types, scrolls, and launches/focuses apps to operate your machine step by step — every input action gated by your per-turn approval, with a Settings master switch. **Desktop-only**; works out of the box on Windows (no extra permissions; UAC/elevated windows stay protected) and on macOS (needs Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions). See [AI Chat — Computer use](docs/en/guide/ai-chat.md#computer-use-screen-control).
- **💾 Multi-Database** — First-launch wizard picks H2, SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL; passwords AES-GCM encrypted. See [Database](docs/en/guide/database).
- **🔔 Unified notifications** — One host pipeline surfaces agent-run completions, plugin `notify` calls, and future host events: live toasts while the app is visible, native OS notifications when it is not, and a persisted notification center (sidebar bell + unread badge) shared by web and desktop. See [REST API — Notifications](docs/en/reference/rest-api.md#notifications).
- **🎨 Material Design 3** — Vuetify 3 MD3 UI, shared with plugin micro-frontends, dark and light themes. See [Design System](docs/en/design-system).
- **🌍 Internationalization** — English-first docs and a localized Vue UI (vue-i18n).

## How it works

You state a business goal in chat; the Agent plans steps and calls the best-fit surface — a `.fyp`
plugin for a concrete capability, a `.fys` skill for domain procedure, or an in-process AI tool.
Steps that touch the outside world (sending email, writing files, mutating data) need your explicit
approval. Results flow back into the conversation, and the Agent re-plans on failure. See the
[Features](docs/en/features) page for the full capability matrix.

## Architecture

Infinia 4.0.0 is a **three-layer web + desktop application**:

![Infinia 4.0.0 system architecture](docs/assets/architecture-en.png)

Editable Excalidraw sources — this overview:
[`fengyu-architecture-overview.en.excalidraw`](docs/assets/fengyu-architecture-overview.en.excalidraw) ·
detailed: [English](docs/assets/fengyu-architecture.en.excalidraw) /
[中文](docs/assets/fengyu-architecture.excalidraw). Drag any of them onto
[excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) to edit. The layers: Electron shell / browser
clients; the Vue 3 SPA with the FengyuFlow canvas; the headless Spring Boot backend
(REST/SSE controllers, AI engine, Flow execution engine `ai/workflow/`, plugin runtime,
skill subsystem); the process-isolated `.fyp` plugins (sandboxed iframe UI + JSON-RPC
stdio worker, `flowNodes` manifest overlay feeding the Flow canvas); and the peer
extension surfaces — skills and the dev-time plugin toolchain on its own version line.

The backend binds **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1:24056` by default) and every request (except
`/api/health`, `/api/setup/*`, and plugin UI static assets) is gated by the per-launch
`X-FengYu-Token` header. The desktop shell sidecar-launches the JAR, waits for health, and exposes
the token + api-base to the renderer via a `contextBridge` preload. See [Architecture Overview](docs/en/architecture/overview).

### Project Modules

| Module / dir | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `toolchain/sdk-{java,python,go}` | Worker SDKs sharing the protocol-v1 handshake; `toolchain/sdk-ts` is the iframe `postMessage` bridge. |
| `OfficialPlugins` | Official plugins: `plugin-markdown`, `plugin-excel`, `plugin-email`, `plugin-offlinepython` (each ships a `.fyp`). Browser automation is now a host-embedded capability, not a plugin. |
| `FengYu` | Headless Spring Boot backend — REST/SSE controllers, AI backends, JPA/Hibernate, marketplace. |
| `frontend/` | Vue 3.5 + TS SPA (runs identically in the browser or the Electron BrowserWindow). |
| `desktop/` | Electron 43.x desktop shell — sidecar-launches the JAR, tray, native dialogs, auto-updater. |
| `toolchain/ui/` | `@infinia/plugin-ui` — the official Vue/Vuetify component kit for plugin micro-frontends. |
| `toolchain/cli/` | Toolchain 2 `fengyu` CLI — conventional `init`, `dev`, `check`, and `build` commands. |
| `toolchain/dev/` | `@infinia/plugin-dev` — Vite plugin that turns the dev server into a FengYu host simulator for IDE debugging. |
| `toolchain/devkit-java/` | `fengyu-plugin-devkit` — loopback-TCP JSON-RPC dev server (`PluginDevMain`) so worker breakpoints fire in the IDE. |

### Plugin System

Plugins are isolated **`.fyp`** packages (a zip of `manifest.json` + `ui/` + a conventional
`backend/worker.jar`, `worker.py`, or native `worker[.exe]`).
The UI runs in a **sandboxed iframe** and talks to the host through the `@infinia/plugin-sdk`
`postMessage` bridge; the backend is an **out-of-process worker** speaking newline-delimited
JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio. A worker crash can never take down the host, and workers never touch the
host Spring context or JPA session.

File selection uploads into a scoped temporary grant; on desktop the Electron shell resolves a native
path into the same opaque `FileRef`. Plugin UI code is identical on both targets and never sees an
absolute path. Plugins that need persistence declare the `database` permission and get an
injected datasource connection (table-name-prefixed, plugin-owned schema).

Third-party authors choose `fengyu init --runtime java|python|go`, run the UI simulator with
`fengyu dev`, start Java `PluginDevMain`, Python `worker.py --dev`, or Go `go run . --dev`, validate
with `fengyu check`, and package with `fengyu build`. The
standard layout needs no build-command DSL; there is no `FengYuPluginV2` interface or in-host JavaFX.
See the [Plugin Overview](docs/en/plugins/overview).

## Database

Infinia uses **JPA + Hibernate** and supports **four database backends**, chosen at first launch
via a setup wizard. No database knowledge is required for the default local experience.

### First-launch setup wizard

On first launch (no `<program-working-directory>/.fengyu/config/datasource.properties`), the
backend boots in **SETUP mode** and the frontend shows a wizard that lets you pick a database:

- **H2** (default, local embedded) — zero configuration.
- **SQLite** (local embedded) — single-file database.
- **MySQL** (remote) — for multi-user or server deployment.
- **PostgreSQL** (remote) — for multi-user or server deployment.

The wizard tests the connection, persists the configuration under
`<program-working-directory>/.fengyu/config/` (passwords AES-GCM encrypted, machine-bound), and
stores an embedded database under `<program-working-directory>/.fengyu/database/`, then exits
(`SETUP_DONE=0`). The desktop supervisor restarts the backend into **APP mode**, where Hibernate
`ddl-auto=update` creates the schema from the JPA entities. To reconfigure, delete
`datasource.properties` and restart — the wizard reappears. See [Database](docs/en/guide/database).
