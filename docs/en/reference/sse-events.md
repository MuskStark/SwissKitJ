title: SSE Events
description: The complete taxonomy of server-sent events for the three Infinia SSE streams — GET /api/ai/stream (chat), GET /api/agent/stream (agent), and GET /api/notifications/stream (host notifications) — every event name, its payload shape, and when it fires.

# SSE Events

Infinia streams three kinds of work over [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events): chat turns, agent runs, and host notifications. `EventSource` cannot set headers, so each stream is opened with a query id (`?streamId=` or `?runId=`) plus a one-time `?ticket=` minted by the matching header-authenticated `POST .../stream-ticket` endpoint — there is **no** `?token=` parameter (the full credential must not ride in a URL that logs capture).

Every event is an SSE frame whose `event:` line names the type and whose `data:` line carries a JSON payload. The chat and agent streams open with a `:connected` comment heartbeat — which confirms the stream is open before any events arrive — and the notification stream sends a `:heartbeat` comment every 25 seconds while idle.

```text
: connected

event: <type>
data: { ...json... }
```

See [REST API](/en/reference/rest-api) for how the streams are started (`POST /api/ai/chat`, `POST /api/agent/run`).

## Chat stream

`GET /api/ai/stream?streamId=<uuid>` — the stream for a chat turn started by `POST /api/ai/chat`. See [AI Chat](/en/guide/ai-chat).

| Event | Data shape | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `{text}` | A chunk of the assistant's reply. Concatenate in order to rebuild the message. |
| `thinking` | `{text}` | A chunk of the model's chain-of-thought. Rendered as collapsed cards. |
| `tool` (call) | `{phase:"call", name, arguments}` | The model decided to call a tool. `arguments` is the JSON-serialized argument string. |
| `tool` (result) | `{phase:"result", id, success, output}` | The tool returned. `success:false` carries an error in `output`. |
| `done` | `{text, tokens, tps}` | The turn is complete. `text` is the full reply; `tokens` is the count; `tps` is tokens/sec. |
| `error` | `{message}` | The run failed. The stream ends after this frame. |

A representative chat stream:

```text
: connected

event: token
data: {"text":"Let me check "}

event: thinking
data: {"text":"The user wants sheet names; I'll call excel_analyze."}

event: tool
data: {"phase":"call","name":"excel_analyze","arguments":"{\"filePath\":...}"}

event: tool
data: {"phase":"result","id":"...","success":true,"output":"..."}

event: token
data: {"text":"the workbook has 3 sheets."}

event: done
data: {"text":"Let me check the workbook has 3 sheets.","tokens":42,"tps":18.6}
```

The `tool` event uses the same name for both phases and disambiguates via the `phase` field. Built-in `@FengYuTool`s and plugin `aiTools` are indistinguishable on the wire — see [AI Tools](/en/plugins/ai-tools).

## Agent stream

`GET /api/agent/stream?runId=<uuid>` — the stream for an agent run started by `POST /api/agent/run`. See [AI Agent](/en/guide/ai-agent).

| Event | Data shape | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plan_token` | plan text chunk | The model is streaming the draft plan, token by token. |
| `plan_ready` | `{ plan: AgentPlan }` | The plan is finalized and ready for review. |
| `plan_approval_requested` | `{gateId}` | The runner is paused, waiting for you to approve the plan before executing. `gateId` is the armed gate's credential — send it back with the approve call. |
| `step_start` | step descriptor | A step has begun executing. |
| `step_retry` | `{index, nextAttempt, maxAttempts, delayMs, error}` | A retry-safe attempt failed and the runner is waiting (or immediately continuing when `delayMs` is zero) before `nextAttempt`. The event is also retained in run history. |
| `step_complete` | step result | A step finished. The payload's `resultTruncated` is `true` when the displayed result was size-capped by the backend. |
| `step_skipped` | step index | A step was omitted by control flow (its `runWhen` branch did not fire, or every dependency was skipped). No result is produced. |
| `step_approval_requested` | `{index, gateId}` | A step needs your approval before it runs; `gateId` identifies the armed gate. |
| `complete` | final result | The whole run finished successfully. |
| `error` | `{message}` | The run failed. The stream ends after this frame. |

The end-to-end ordering, with the two approval gates:

```text
: connected

event: plan_token
data: {"text":"1. Read the workbook"}

event: plan_ready
data: {"plan":{ /* AgentPlan */ }}

event: plan_approval_requested
data: { /* gate details */ }

# → POST /api/agent/{runId}/approve  (releases the gate)

event: step_start
data: { /* step descriptor */ }

event: step_retry
data: {"index":0,"nextAttempt":2,"maxAttempts":3,"delayMs":500,"error":"temporary outage"}

event: step_complete
data: { /* step result */ }

event: complete
data: { /* final result */ }
```

### Approval gates

Both `plan_approval_requested` and `step_approval_requested` are released by the same endpoint — `POST /api/agent/{runId}/approve`. Send no body to approve as-is, or an edited `AgentPlan` body to override the draft. The optional `gateId` body field carries the credential from the approval-request event: when supplied it must match the currently armed gate, and a duplicate, late, or stale-credential approve answers **409** instead of silently releasing whatever newer gate has armed since — clients refresh the run state on 409. Cancel with `POST /api/agent/{runId}/cancel`; cancel is cooperative, so the runner stops at the next safe point and the stream ends without `complete`. See [AI Agent — Approval gates](/en/guide/ai-agent#approval-gates).

## Notification stream

`GET /api/notifications/stream?ticket=<one-time>` — the live channel of the unified host
notification center. Mint the ticket through `POST /api/notifications/stream-ticket` first
(see [REST API — Notifications](/en/reference/rest-api#notifications)).

Unlike the chat and agent streams this one is **long-lived and shared**: one connection per
shell, kept open for the whole session, with a 25-second comment heartbeat while idle.
History is NOT replayed on it — load it with `GET /api/notifications` and dedupe live
events by `id`. A dropped connection is safe to re-open with a fresh ticket; the shell
refetches history on reconnect to close any gap.

| Event | Data shape | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `notification` | `{id, source, level, title, body, link, read, createdAt, readAt}` | A notification was created (persisted first, then fanned out live). |

The shell renders an in-app toast when its window is visible and asks the Electron main
process for a native OS notification when it is not (clicking it focuses the window).
`source` identifies the originator — `agent` titles are localized by the shell via i18n;
`plugin:<id>` rows carry the plugin's display name as the stored title.

## Conventions

- The first frame on every stream is the `: connected` comment — it is not an event, just a heartbeat.
- Every `data:` line is a single JSON object. Parse it with `JSON.parse`; do not assume string fields beyond those listed.
- An `error` frame is always terminal — the server closes the stream immediately after.
- Streams are not resumable. If the connection drops, start a new run; `streamId` / `runId` are single-use.

## Next steps
