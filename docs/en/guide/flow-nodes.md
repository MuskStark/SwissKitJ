# Flow Nodes

The FengyuFlow canvas is a **dataflow editor**: every node is one tool invocation, every edge says "this node runs after that one and may read its output". This page explains what flows along the wires and how to debug one node in isolation. For the authoring side of the node declaration protocol, see [Flow nodes](../plugins/manifest.md#flownodes) in the plugin manifest reference.

## Nodes and edges

- **Start** — the visual editor for the flow's run-time inputs. Each declared input renders as a typed chip row; referencing one on the canvas is <code v-pre>{{inputs.email}}</code>.
- **Action nodes** — one tool each. RPC JSON Schema supplies fields, types, requiredness, and
  defaults; an optional `flowNodes` overlay adds widgets, labels, placeholders, examples, and help.
- **Condition node (IF)** — the built-in `flow_if` control node. It compares two values and exposes two output ports, **true / false**. Every action node has exactly one output port; the condition node is the only one with two, because the port an edge leaves from *is* the branch semantics.

Edges are dependencies: a node runs once everything upstream has finished (ready steps run concurrently). Wiring is whole-node — you don't connect individual fields; a field may bind either to an upstream node's **effective input** or to its worker **result**.

## Getting data in: references

Every input has three source states:

| State | What it does |
|---|---|
| ✏️ Manual | A literal value typed into the widget |
| 🔗 Reference | Pick from the **variable tree**: workflow inputs, upstream effective inputs, or upstream result fields, filtered by the expected type |
| ƒ Expression | Raw text with <code v-pre>{{ }}</code> placeholders — string templates for experts |

References serialize directly: <code v-pre>{{node.&lt;id&gt;.input.&lt;path&gt;}}</code> reads the value the upstream tool actually received after template resolution, <code v-pre>{{node.&lt;id&gt;.result.&lt;path&gt;}}</code> reads its worker result, and <code v-pre>{{inputs.&lt;name&gt;}}</code> reads a run-time input. Paths accept array indexes such as `result.files[0]`. The picker separates **Input** and **Output**, and unknown references are flagged before save.

## Seeing what a node outputs

Anywhere outputs are listed you get three tiers, honestly labeled:

1. **Declared** — the plugin's output schema (field names and types).
2. **Example** — the declaration's example values.
3. **Last run** — the node's real output from the most recent execution (truncated to 16 KB in the graph).

Hover a node's output port for the declared contract; open the node to browse the full output tree, copy a <code v-pre>{{node.…}}</code> reference path, or pin the last run.

## Branch conditions and skips

Draw an edge from the IF node's **true** or **false** port and the compile step turns it into a `runWhen` condition on the target. At run time:

- The IF node evaluates (`contains`, `gt`, `is_empty`, … — both operands may bind upstream references) and outputs `{"branch":"true|false"}`.
- Steps whose branch did not fire are recorded **skipped** — gray badge on the node, no result, no tool call.
- A step whose dependencies were *all* skipped is skipped too (the dead branch cascades). A step with any live dependency still runs.

## The AI generation node (LLM)

The built-in **AI 生成** node runs one non-interactive model completion as an ordinary
flow step, using whatever provider the AI settings currently have active:

- **提示词 (prompt)** — the full instruction; bind upstream outputs with 🔗 references
  exactly like any other input (e.g. hand the Excel summary to the model for rewriting).
- **系统提示词 / 温度** (advanced) — an optional role ("你是邮件文案助手") and an optional
  sampling temperature 0–2; blank falls back to the global AI settings.
- **输出 Schema** (advanced) — a JSON Schema object. When set, the model is instructed to
  answer with a matching JSON object, available under the **结构化数据 (data)** output for
  field-by-field referencing (<code v-pre>{{node.x.result.data.sentiment}}</code>). If the reply fails to
  parse or misses required fields, one repair retry feeds the exact error back into the
  prompt. The **原文 (text)** output always carries the raw reply — structuring can fail,
  the answer never disappears. Pair `data` fields with an IF node to branch on them.

The node builds a fresh model client per call, so it works inside parallel steps and even
in flows executed from chat via `run_current_flow` without contending with the active
conversation.

## Debugging a single node

**Run this node** (in the node inspector's output section) executes *only that node*:

- Upstream result references resolve from each upstream node's **pinned** result or **last run** value; input references resolve from that node's configured effective arguments — no ancestors are re-executed.
- Workflow inputs bind from the current values in the flow settings.
- The result lands in the same places a full run fills: the node badge, the execution panel, run history, and the node's last-run preview.

If an upstream node has neither a pin nor a last run, the run tells you which one to run or pin first. Combined with **rewind** (re-run from step N after a full run) and **pin**, you can iterate on one node without the whole chain passing.

## Checks before execution

Before any node runs, the host checks tool availability, reference paths, retry policies,
and whole-value bindings whose declared types are incompatible (for example, an array
bound to a string input). Errors identify the step and input path. Text interpolation
remains a string; unknown or overlapping types still require runtime validation.
Fixed results are also checked for failure envelopes and against declared output schemas
before the first node runs, so an invalid later pin cannot cause earlier nodes to execute.
These checks do not prove that external services are available or replace runtime input
and output validation.

## Pinned results

Pinning freezes a node's last run as its authored result: the engine serves the pinned value verbatim, never calling the tool — useful to iterate downstream against a known payload. Pinned nodes carry a 📌 marker; publishing a flow with pins is allowed but the pins stay in effect until removed.

## Failure retries

The node inspector exposes **Failure retry** only when the tool is retry-safe. Choose 1–5 total
attempts and an initial delay; the delay doubles after each failure and is capped at 30 seconds.
Approval happens once before the attempt sequence, and run history records one terminal step result.
While retrying, the canvas and execution panel show the upcoming attempt, delay, and last error;
the same attempt timeline remains visible when reopening a persisted run.

Read-only tools are retry-safe automatically. A write or external plugin tool must explicitly
declare `idempotent: true`, meaning repeating the identical invocation cannot duplicate a write,
message, charge, or other side effect. Tools without that guarantee cannot be retried; the backend
also rejects an unsafe policy supplied outside the UI before the first call.

## Starting a published flow externally

The run dialog can turn a published flow into a durable loopback webhook. The values currently in
the dialog become defaults; each incoming JSON object's fields override them. The one-time secret
and optional event ID protocol are documented under [Workflow webhooks](./ai-agent.md#workflow-webhooks).
Flows with picker-file or auto-shared-directory inputs cannot create webhooks because those grants
are session-scoped rather than durable.

## Draft and restart recovery

Unsaved canvas edits are written to a workflow-scoped local draft after a short debounce. Reopening
the route offers to restore it; saving or intentionally discarding clears it. A backend restart
during a run records a **Recovery required** checkpoint instead of pretending the run failed. Resume
always returns to plan review and reuses stable per-step invocation IDs so idempotent workers can
deduplicate an uncertain call. Runs whose remaining steps contain session-scoped file grants cannot
resume after restart; start a new run and select those files again.
