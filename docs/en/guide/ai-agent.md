# AI Agent

The AI Agent is a **plan-and-execute** runner. Give it a goal in plain language and it drafts a multi-step plan, asks you to approve the plan (and optionally each step), then executes dependency-ready steps concurrently — streaming progress back over SSE. It is built on the same chat backends and reuses the host's aggregated tools, including MCP tools, so anything callable from chat is callable from an agent run.

## Request flow

A run starts with a goal plus an `AgentConfig`, then streams over SSE keyed by `runId`.

```text
POST /api/agent/run
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-FengYu-Token: <token>
  { "goal": "Split invoices.xlsx by the Region column", "config": { ... } }

  ◄── 200 { "runId": "<uuid>" }

GET /api/agent/stream?runId=<uuid>
  X-FengYu-Token: <token>
  Accept: text/event-stream

  ◄── SSE stream (see below)
```

::: tip
Browser `EventSource` cannot set custom headers. The desktop UI therefore opens the stream with
`?runId=...&token=...`; non-browser clients may instead use `X-FengYu-Token`.
:::

### Caller-supplied workflow

The request body accepts an optional `workflow` (an `AgentPlan`). Omit it to let the active model
plan from `goal`; supply it to drive **deterministic execution** — the runner validates the supplied
plan (model- or user-authored) before any tool runs, so the HTTP API can execute a known graph
without depending on LLM planning.

```json
{
  "goal": "Split invoices.xlsx by the Region column",
  "config": { ... },
  "workflow": { "steps": [ ... ] }
}
```

The flow builder's visual canvas (below) compiles to exactly this `workflow` field, so the canvas and
the AI plan path are peers against the same runner.

### Visual flows (Flows view)

The **Flows** view (`/flows`, Flowise-inspired) is the no-code peer to letting the model plan. A
library page lists saved flows and one-click templates; opening one enters the full-workspace flow
builder: a categorized node palette on the left (search + collapsible groups, drag to add), the Vue
Flow canvas in the middle, a node configuration panel on the right, and Flowise-style sticky notes
for annotations. The canvas is a 1:1 replica of Flowise's **AgentFlow v2 canvas** (the dark
canvas from the screenshot), rebuilt in pure Vue on vue-flow after reading the original source:
per-node-type colors straight from `tokens.ts` tint the card (`darken(color, 0.8)`, MUI formula),
the 40px rounded-square icon badge, the 5×20 color-bar input handle, the hover-revealed chevron
output handle, gradient bezier edges (source→target color) with hover delete buttons, the
#1a1a1a dot-grid surface, bottom-center controls with snap/background toggles, and the dark
minimap. Structural edits — node/edge/note add, remove (toolbar, buttons, or the Delete key),
and moves — are all undoable (toolbar buttons or ⌘/Ctrl+Z / ⇧⌘Z), capped at 50 steps. `workflow.ts` compiles the graph into the `AgentPlan` sent to
`POST /api/agent/run` — the same runner, validation, and step-result references apply (e.g.
`steps.N.result` or `last.result`, substituted into a later step's arguments). Tools are disabled
during planning so the model only structures the workflow, never executes tools while planning.

Canvas edges compile to each step's `dependsOn` list. Steps in the same dependency level run on
virtual threads in parallel; a dependent step starts only after all prerequisites complete.

### Node configuration: three ways to fill an input

Every input on the node panel has a three-state **source control** (manual / reference /
expression):

- **Manual** — the widget form (text, number, dropdown, row editor, workbook analyze…), with
  the declaration's placeholder and example value as hints.
- **Reference** — opens the variable tree: workflow inputs plus every upstream node's outputs
  as a recursive tree (object fields and array elements expand; `[0]` sample children make
  index paths discoverable). Rows are filtered by the input's expected type — mismatched
  values are grayed with a reason — and can be clicked, dragged onto the input, or
  copy-path'd for the expression editor. Selecting an upstream output auto-creates the edge.
- **Expression** — a text template with <code v-pre>{{node.&lt;id&gt;.result.&lt;path&gt;}}</code> / <code v-pre>{{inputs.&lt;name&gt;}}</code>
  references embedded in prose; unknown references are flagged inline before saving.

The same grammar now accepts **array indexes** — <code v-pre>{{node.n.result.files[0].name}}</code> — on both
the canvas and the backend runner.

### Seeing the data: ports, previews, and pinned results

- **Typed ports.** Declared outputs color their handles by data type (text / number / object /
  list / file; gray = undeclared = anything) and the port label's tooltip shows type,
  description, and an example value.
- **Upstream data preview.** The node panel folds a preview of everything upstream nodes can
  provide: declared fields with examples, upgraded to **actual last-run values** (with the
  value at each field's path) once the flow has run. Every row has a copy-reference button.
- **Output viewer & pinning.** A node's own outputs show the same declared → example →
  last-run degradation, and a finished step's real result can be **pinned**: later runs serve
  the pinned value without executing that tool (the node carries a pin marker; the run keeps
  the step in the dependency graph). Pinning is per-flow debug scaffolding — unpin to execute
  again.
- **Run badges.** During a run, nodes show live status (running / done / failed) right on the
  card, so execution is legible without opening the run panel.

### The Start node

New flows open with a **Start node** — the visual editor for the workflow's run-time inputs.
Add fields (name, label, type, required, options, example) and they become both the run-form
schema and typed output rows on the card; nodes reference them as
<code v-pre>{{inputs.name}}</code>. The JSON Schema view remains available in the settings
drawer and inside the Start panel for power users.

### Every tool is a node

The palette shows explicitly declared nodes first (typed ports, examples, help) and, behind a
"show all tools" toggle, every remaining orchestrable tool as a schema-derived fallback node —
nothing capable stays hidden from the author. Plugin authors upgrade a fallback node by adding
a `flowNodes` declaration to the manifest (see the plugin docs); the declaration schema now
covers types, nested output fields, examples, per-field help, and node-level help.

### Chat, generate, and diagnose a flow

The builder ships a docked AI panel (bottom-right) over the same tool-call loop as AI Chat.
Each turn carries a snapshot of the **live canvas**, including an unsaved or currently invalid
graph, and binds three request-scoped authoring tools:

- `inspect_current_flow` returns the live graph, input contract, current editor diagnostics, and
  the installed tools' input/output contracts.
- `diagnose_current_flow` checks unavailable tools, missing required arguments, malformed
  references, dangling connections, dependency cycles, and the last run error without changing
  the canvas.
- `edit_current_flow` creates a complete replacement proposal from an empty canvas or edits the
  existing graph. It never writes a workflow directly.

An edit result appears as a node/connection diff. **Apply and save** first rejects a stale proposal
if the canvas or revision changed, then rehydrates it through the live tool catalog and uses the
normal canvas compiler, validation, optimistic revision check, undo history, and save path. A
failed validation leaves the proposed graph on the canvas for review; dismissing a proposal makes
no change.

When pending edits form a valid graph, the turn auto-saves them first and also exposes that clean
saved definition — **draft or published** — as `run_current_flow`, with the same permission modes,
approval gates, and SSE `tool` events as AI Chat. An invalid graph remains available to the
inspection and diagnosis tools but is deliberately not executable as `run_current_flow`. Published
flows remain available to ordinary AI Chat as `run_workflow_<id>`.

### Reusable workflows: manual and AI invocation

The builder can persist a graph as a reusable workflow instead of sending a one-off `AgentPlan`.
Each definition stores a name, description, JSON Schema input contract, the compiled plan, the
authored canvas graph, publication state, and revision. Use <code v-pre>{{inputs.name}}</code> in the goal or any node argument; an exact placeholder keeps
the JSON value's original type, while a placeholder embedded in text is rendered as a string.
Existing <code v-pre>{{steps.N.result...}}</code> references continue to connect step outputs.

- **Manual:** select the saved workflow, enter an input JSON object, and run it. The host binds the
  inputs, validates required fields and basic JSON Schema types, then starts a normal agent run.
- **AI:** publish the workflow. It immediately appears in the live Spring AI catalog as
  `run_workflow_<id>`, using the workflow input schema as its tool schema. The model's tool call
  binds the same inputs and uses the same DAG runner, persisted run history, and tool callbacks.

Publication is snapshot-based. Editing a published flow creates newer draft changes while AI keeps
running the last reviewed immutable revision. **Publish changes** promotes the draft to a new
snapshot; the settings drawer lists all published versions and can restore an older one into a new
draft without changing the active version until it is published again. Revision checks on save,
publish, and restore return HTTP 409 when another editor has moved the definition forward.

AI invocation cannot pause for human approval inside the synchronous tool call, so published
workflow execution uses the permissions already granted to the outer chat tool call. Manual runs
retain the normal per-step approval policy. Workflow tools cannot be nested in saved definitions;
this prevents recursive invocation and keeps execution/audit boundaries explicit.

### Workflow authoring guardrails

The canvas fails at authoring time rather than mid-run, and never silently loses work:

- **Saved graphs.** A definition stores the authored canvas graph verbatim — nodes, edges, sticky
  notes, and node ids — so a saved flow reopens exactly as it was arranged (node ids are what
  references addressed by node id survive reloads too). Definitions saved
  before graph persistence reconstruct the canvas from the compiled plan + layout.
- **Save-time validation.** Saving rejects <code v-pre>{{inputs.*}}</code> references that the
  input schema never declares — a graph that could only ever fail at binding time — and caps
  definitions at 64 steps.
- **Safe failure retries.** Retry-safe nodes can use 1–5 total attempts with exponential backoff.
  Read tools qualify automatically; write/external plugin tools qualify only when their manifest
  explicitly declares `idempotent: true`. Other tools cannot be configured to retry, and a forged
  unsafe retry plan is rejected before execution.
- **Run-time input gating.** The run dialog blocks the start until required workflow inputs are
  filled, naming the missing fields; the host re-validates on `POST /api/workflows/{id}/run`.
- **Unsaved-changes protection.** Switching, creating, or deleting a workflow with unsaved canvas
  edits asks for confirmation first, and closing the tab or leaving the view triggers the
  browser's leave guard.
- **Save a copy.** Every flow card in the library offers a one-click duplicate — the fastest
  path from an existing example to "my version".
- **Per-step results.** The run panel and plan view show each completed step's actual output
  (collapsed behind a *Result* toggle), both for live runs and when reopening a persisted run.
- **Localized errors.** Host validation messages (missing inputs, undeclared references, name
  limits, publication state) surface localized in the UI instead of raw English exceptions.

### One-click templates and run-time pickers

Building a graph from a blank canvas still requires knowing the tools. For the common
"split a workbook, then email each part" scenario the Flows view ships a built-in template
gallery (on the library page and in the builder's empty state): **Excel split → batch email** pre-wires
`excel_complex_config → excel_execute → email_send_batch → confirm_send`, pre-maps every
output reference (including the nested `confirmation.confirmationId`), and ships a run-form
input schema an ordinary user just fills in:

- **File inputs** (`format: "fengyu-file"`) render an upload picker in the run dialog. The
  picked file is granted to every eligible plugin and travels with the run; node arguments
  carry it as an `@file:<input>` placeholder the host swaps for the current plugin's
  FileRef right before dispatch.
- **Shared output folders** (`"x-fengyu-auto": "shared-directory"`) need no user interaction:
  the run mints one host-owned scratch directory and grants it *live* to every eligible
  plugin — files an Excel step writes are immediately readable by a later Email step, on
  every sandbox backend (this is the cross-plugin hand-off that a plugin's private default
  output folder cannot provide).
- **Dynamic option inputs** (`"x-fengyu-enum"` referencing a plugin list tool such as
  `email_accounts_list` or `email_tags_list`) render live dropdowns — the user picks
  "alice@example.com" or a recipient group, never a numeric id.
- **The send step is approval-gated.** `confirm_send` is an `external`-effect tool and the
  template marks it *requires approval*: every permission mode except full-access pauses the
  run at that step, and one click in the run panel releases it — the workflow equivalent of
  the chat confirmation card.

Under the hood, `POST /api/agent/run` and `POST /api/workflows/{id}/run` accept a `files`
array (`{name, refs | nativePath | createSharedDirectory}`); the resolved grants attach to
the run and bind `@file:<name>` placeholders during step dispatch.

## Permission rules & lifecycle hooks

Between the coarse permission modes and each tool call sits a user-configurable guard,
evaluated in a fixed order:

```text
PreToolUse hooks → deny rules → ask rules → allow rules → permission-mode default
```

**Rules** are configured in Settings (one per line) and evaluated order-independently —
a deny always beats an allow, regardless of declaration order:

| Rule | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `Command(git status)`, `Command(git:*)` | `execute_command` — word-boundary prefix or glob |
| `Tool(excel_*)`, `Tool(browser_navigate)` | tool names (glob) |
| `Effect(read)` | every tool declaring that effect |
| `Mcp(github__*)`, `mcp__github` | MCP tools by qualified name |
| `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` | `web_fetch`/`web_search` on a host or subdomain |

Shell chains are checked per segment: a deny/ask rule matches **any** segment of an
`a && b | c` chain, while an allow rule only grants when **every** segment independently
matches — so `Command(git status)` cannot authorize `git status && rm -rf /`. A
dangerous-command floor (`rm`, `sudo`, `kill`, `git push`, …) voids allow rules; those
commands always ask. A denied call fails its step with the rule's reason, which the
model can see and replan around.

**Hooks** extend the same pipeline. A hook is `{name, event, matcher, type, command|url,
timeoutSeconds, enabled}`; `command` hooks receive the event envelope as JSON on stdin,
HTTP hooks receive it as a POST body:

- `pre_tool_use` — a gate: exit code 2 denies (first stderr line is the reason), stdout
  JSON `{"decision":"deny","reason":"…"}` denies on any exit code; exit 0 (or a JSON
  allow) lets the call proceed.
- `post_tool_use` / `post_tool_use_failure` — observe finished calls (arguments + result).
- `run_complete` / `run_error` — observe agent-run termination.

Hook failures (crash, unknown exit code, timeout) **fail open**: the failure is logged
and the tool call proceeds. FengYu is a local personal tool where an induced hook failure
is not part of the threat model; blocking every call because a hook crashed would turn
the feature into a self-inflicted outage.

**Plugins can contribute hooks** (a `hooks/hooks.json` inside a `.fyp` package, grok-shaped
`{"hooks": {"PreToolUse": […]}}` or FengYu's flat list). Installing or enabling a plugin
never activates its hooks — the user must trust the plugin explicitly
(`POST /api/plugin-hooks/{id}/trust`); untrusting takes effect on the next call. Trusted
plugin hooks run with the plugin's install directory as working directory and receive
`FENGYU_PLUGIN_ROOT`/`FENGYU_PLUGIN_DATA` in their environment, and their names are
namespaced `plugin/<id>/<name>` for audit trails.

## Background tasks

Long workflows no longer occupy the synchronous tool slot. The model can call
`task_submit_workflow(workflowId, inputs)` to launch a published workflow in the
background (it returns a `taskId` immediately), then `task_output(taskId, timeoutMs)` to
poll or block, `task_wait(ids, "any"|"all", timeoutMs)` to wait on up to 20 tasks at
once, and `task_kill(taskId)` to stop a runaway task — cooperative cancellation first,
SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation for process-backed tasks. `task_capacity` reports global queue
pressure and limits, the interactive/normal/batch mix and reservations, active-owner count, oldest
queue wait per priority class, saturation and scheduling policy plus the current owner's share and
32-task queue
allowance without exposing another owner's task details.
The same registry backs `GET /api/agent/tasks` and `GET /api/agent/tasks/capacity` for the UI.
Task snapshots and capped output are owner-scoped and
persisted; the latest 100 finished tasks remain available after restart. A task that was still
queued or running when the process stopped is recovered as an explicit interrupted failure and is
not replayed, because its in-process work and external side effects cannot be resumed safely.

The host runs at most 16 background-task bodies concurrently. Up to 128 additional submissions
wait in a bounded global queue instead of being rejected during a short burst, while one owner may
queue at most 32. This per-owner bound prevents a racing producer from consuming every queue slot
before another owner arrives. Within those bounds, batch work may occupy at most 16 owner slots and
64 global slots, while batch plus normal work may occupy at most 24 owner slots and 96 global slots.
That leaves eight slots per owner and 32 globally for interactive work even when lower-priority
producers race. Webhook deliveries are interactive, model-submitted workflows are normal, and
schedule fires are batch. Tasks remain FIFO within each owner-priority queue; owners take turns,
and each owner selects interactive/normal/batch work in a bounded 4:2:1 cycle
(`owner-round-robin-weighted-priority`). This guarantees a batch turn under sustained interactive
load while remaining work-conserving when another class or owner has no work. `task_list`, the REST
API, and the run panel expose `priority` and `queued` separately from `running`. Killing a queued
task cancels it before its body starts and releases queue capacity. The run panel refreshes while
open, displays global/current-owner utilization and the priority mix, and warns when either queue
bound is full or the oldest task has waited at least 30 seconds — naming the priority class
(interactive, normal, or batch) that is actually aging, because the capacity API reports
`oldestInteractiveQueueWaitMs`/`oldestNormalQueueWaitMs`/`oldestBatchQueueWaitMs` alongside the
global `oldestQueueWaitMs`. Each task snapshot records
`queueWaitMs` and, once its body starts, `startedAt` plus `runDurationMs`; active durations advance
until the task starts or finishes, making sustained queue pressure visible instead of requiring
log inspection. When total capacity is exhausted, HTTP callers receive `429 Too Many Requests`
with `Retry-After: 1`; `task_submit_workflow` returns the equivalent structured `retryable` and
`retryAfterSeconds` fields. Both include `capacityScope`; its value is `owner`, `global`,
`owner-priority`, or `global-priority`, and priority-reservation failures also include
`capacityPriority`. `task_capacity` additionally exposes the global and owner batch/non-interactive
limits and counts, `ownerQueueLimit`, `ownedQueueAvailable`, and `ownerSaturated`. A webhook rejected before admission releases its hashed idempotency
claim, so retrying the same event ID after the delay is safe.
Cancellation registration is race-safe: if a producer attaches its workflow/process canceller
after a kill has already arrived, the canceller runs immediately rather than losing the request.

The scheduler also publishes its queueing pressure through Micrometer (Actuator's
`/actuator/metrics` locally; an OTLP collector in production via `management.otlp.metrics.export.url`),
with semantics calibrated against Kubernetes API Priority and Fairness and Temporal's
schedule-to-start latency: `fengyu.bg.tasks.dispatched` and `fengyu.bg.tasks.rejected` counters
per priority — rejections tagged with the limiting `owner`/`global`/`owner-priority`/
`global-priority` scope — the `fengyu.bg.task.queue.wait` schedule-to-start histogram split by
`executed` versus `cancelled` outcome, and the `fengyu.bg.queue.inqueue` plus
`fengyu.bg.queue.oldest_wait_ms` gauges per priority. Per-priority SLOs (for example, p99
interactive queue wait, or a stuck-queue alert when the oldest queued task exceeds 30 seconds in
one class) can be expressed directly against these series.

## Workflow schedules

Open **Scheduled tasks** in the main sidebar to create and manage schedules. Select a
published workflow and choose daily, weekly (multiple weekdays), or monthly execution
at a clock time in the selected time zone. The default is daily at 09:00 in the device
time zone. Monthly schedules support the last day; dates 29–31 use the last day of shorter
months. Calendar schedules continue until deleted. Daylight-saving gaps shift the time
forward by the gap; repeated clock times run once using the earlier offset. Fixed intervals
and one-shot delays remain available in minutes or hours. JSON inputs are under Advanced
settings. You can also request an immediate first run. The page shows
the next run, expiry, trigger count, missed intervals and submission errors; opening the
workflow lets you inspect its runs. Delete a schedule to stop future triggers; already
submitted runs continue. The backend must remain running for tasks to execute; closing
it does not wake the computer or launch the application at the scheduled time.

Published workflows can run on a schedule (`POST /api/agent/schedules`, or the
`task_schedule` tool): a minimum interval of 60 seconds, at most 50 active schedules,
automatic expiry after 7 days for interval schedules, an optional immediate first fire, and
`recurring: false` for a delayed one-shot. Scheduled runs submit ordinary background
tasks, so `task_output`/`task_wait`/`task_kill` and the run panel treat them exactly
like manual ones.

Schedules are persisted and restored after an application restart. Recurring schedules keep
their original interval boundaries or local calendar time rather than drifting from the latest wake-up time. If the
application was stopped across several boundaries, those overdue occurrences are coalesced into
one immediate recovery run and the excess is exposed as `missedFires` in the API and run panel.
The scheduler records an at-most-once delivery claim before task submission: an occurrence caught
inside a crash window is reported but not replayed, because duplicating a message, write, or charge
is less safe than missing that occurrence. A schedule created with plugin sandboxing enabled also
pauses if the host later weakens that isolation, and resumes only after sandboxing is restored.
Deleting a workflow cancels its active schedules in the same database transaction.

## Workflow webhooks

A published workflow can also be started by another local application. Open its run dialog, fill
any defaults, choose the permission mode, and select **Create webhook**. The resulting trigger is
durable and owner-scoped; every accepted delivery becomes an ordinary `workflow-webhook`
background task, so its status and capped output remain available in the run panel after restart.

The endpoint is deliberately loopback-only: `POST /api/workflow-hooks/{triggerId}`. Send a JSON
object whose fields override the trigger's saved defaults, plus the one-time
`X-FengYu-Webhook-Secret` value shown at creation. FengYu stores only its SHA-256 digest; rotating
the secret invalidates the old value immediately. An optional `X-FengYu-Event-Id` (maximum 200
characters) is also stored only as a digest. Its database claim happens before task submission, so
concurrent retries receive the original task instead of repeating the workflow. Omit it only when
every delivery is intentionally distinct. Bodies are limited to 256 KiB.

Webhook triggers cannot bind picker-file inputs or auto-created shared directories because those
grants expire with the interactive session. Use persistent plugin-managed data and pass its stable
identifier instead. A trigger created while plugin sandboxing is enabled pauses if isolation is
later weakened. A crash-interrupted event claim is marked interrupted and never replayed: this
prefers a visible missed occurrence over duplicating messages, writes, or charges. Deleting the
workflow disables both its schedules and webhook triggers transactionally.

Expand a trigger in the run panel to inspect its latest deliveries. Each read-only audit row shows
the lifecycle state (`CLAIMED`, `QUEUED`, `SUBMITTED`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, or `INTERRUPTED`), acceptance
and completion times, duration, owning background-task ID, whether an idempotency key was supplied,
and a terminal error when present. Calls without an event ID still receive a distinct audit row.
The history is capped at 1,000 rows per trigger and exposes at most 100 per request. It never stores
or returns the request body, secret, raw event ID, or event-ID hash. FengYu deliberately provides no
blind replay button: after an uncertain crash window, replaying a write-capable workflow could
duplicate an external side effect; submit a reviewed new event instead when recovery is safe.

## Run history: search, fork, rewind

- **Search** — `GET /api/agent/runs?q=…` filters history by goal/summary/error text.
- **Fork** — `POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/fork` copies a finished run's plan into a fresh
  peer run ("try a different approach"), with plan review before execution.
- **Rewind** — `POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/rewind {keepSteps}` truncates the plan to its
  first N steps, inherits only the completed executions below that boundary, and resumes
  with plan review. Side effects of the dropped steps are **not** rolled back — the
  review gate exists precisely so a human can account for them.

Every run also records the plugin-sandbox posture it was created under; resuming,
forking, or rewinding a sandboxed run is refused while the host runs plugins
unsandboxed, so replay can never silently weaken isolation.

## Read-only batch capability

`POST /api/agent/batch` accepts `capabilityMode: "read-only"`, restricting every child
run to `read`-effect tools — the declared shape for parallel research or review tasks.
A plan containing any non-read step is rejected before a single tool runs.

## Cross-session memory (experimental, off by default)

Enable it in Settings and the AI gains `memory_remember` / `memory_search` /
`memory_list` / `memory_forget`: durable facts stored per user, retrieved by keyword
overlap weighted with a 7-day recency half-life, and relevant memories are injected
into the planning context of agent runs. The experimental flag is deliberate restraint —
like every memory feature, it can memorize the wrong thing, so it stays opt-in.

```

## SSE events

Every event is an SSE frame named after its type. See [SSE Events](/en/reference/sse-events) for the full taxonomy.

| Event | When | Carries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plan_token` | The model is streaming the draft plan | plan text chunks |
| `plan_ready` | The plan is finalized | the full `AgentPlan` |
| `plan_approval_requested` | The runner is waiting for you to approve the plan before executing | gate details |
| `step_start` | A step has begun | the step descriptor |
| `step_complete` | A step finished | the step result |
| `step_approval_requested` | A step needs your approval before it runs | gate details |
| `complete` | The whole run finished | the final result |
| `error` | The run failed | `{message}` — the stream ends after this frame |

## Approval gates

The agent pauses at approval gates and will not proceed until you release it. Send approval to the run (not the stream):

```text
POST /api/agent/{runId}/approve
  X-FengYu-Token: <token>

# Optional — send an edited plan to override the model's draft:
  Content-Type: application/json
  { /* an edited AgentPlan */ }
```

- With **no body**, the current plan is approved as-is.
- With an **edited `AgentPlan` body**, the runner adopts your edits before continuing — useful for trimming steps, reordering, or tightening instructions.

The same endpoint releases both `plan_approval_requested` and `step_approval_requested` gates.

## Cancel

Cancel is **cooperative** — the runner checks the flag and stops at the next safe point, so a cancel may not be instant.

```text
POST /api/agent/{runId}/cancel
  X-FengYu-Token: <token>
```

After a cancel the stream ends; the run does not emit `complete`.

## Durable history and resume

Run snapshots and ordered lifecycle events are persisted. `GET /api/agent/runs` lists history and
`GET /api/agent/runs/{runId}` returns the plan, executions, and audit events. A failed, cancelled,
or restart-interrupted run can be resumed with `POST /api/agent/runs/{runId}/resume`. Completed
steps are reused, unfinished steps remain, and the restored plan always pauses for review before
execution.

For independent goals, `POST /api/agent/batch` starts between one and eight isolated run
lifecycles concurrently and returns their `runIds`. Each run keeps separate approvals, cancellation,
history, and SSE observation.

## Available tools

`GET /api/agent/tools` returns the orchestrable tool list the agent can call during its steps:

```text
GET /api/agent/tools
  X-FengYu-Token: <token>

  ◄── 200 [
        { "name": "...", "description": "...", "inputSchema": { /* JSON Schema */ } },
        ...
      ]
