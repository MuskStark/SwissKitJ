# Architecture Overview

Infinia is an **AI-native orchestration platform**. At its core, a plan-and-execute Agent turns
natural-language goals into multi-step business workflows by orchestrating three extension surfaces
— `.fyp` plugins, `.fys` skills, and in-process AI tools. Architecturally, 4.0.0 is a **three-layer
system**: a headless Spring Boot backend, a Vue 3 single-page app, and an Electron desktop shell that
owns the process lifecycle. The same Vue UI runs in a browser tab or inside the Electron window — the
shell just changes how the backend is started and how the UI is served.

## Three layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Electron desktop shell  (desktop/, TypeScript main process)    │
│  • spawns / owns the Java backend process                       │
│  • exposes window.fengyu.{apiBase, token, pickFile, ...} via    │
│    contextBridge before page load                               │
│  • serves the built SPA in a sandboxed BrowserWindow            │
│  • kills the backend on app quit (close → hide to tray)         │
└───────────────┬───────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┘
                │ spawns (release)               │ loads HTML/JS

│  • token-gated REST + SSE        │             │
│  • spawns plugin worker processes│             │

└───────────────┬──────────────────┘             │
                │ HTTP (loopback only)           │
                ▼                                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Vue 3 SPA  (frontend/, TypeScript)                             │
│  Pinia + vue-router 4 + vue-i18n 11, Vuetify 3 (MD3)            │
│  • talks to the backend over the loopback HTTP API              │
│  • loads plugin UI micro-frontends via the MF host              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Request flow

Every request from the UI travels the same loopback path:

1. The SPA (in a browser or in the Electron BrowserWindow) issues an HTTP request to the backend.
2. The request targets `127.0.0.1:<port>`, where `<port>` is the value the backend printed as `FENGYU_PORT=<n>` on startup (default `24056`).
3. The backend's `TokenAuthFilter` inspects the `X-FengYu-Token` header. Requests without a matching token are rejected — with three exemptions: `/api/health`, `/api/setup/*`, and the static plugin UI assets under `/plugin-runtime/{id}/**`.
4. Authenticated requests reach the controllers, which may dispatch work to out-of-process plugin workers via JSON-RPC 2.0.

## Loopback-only bind

The backend forces `server.address=127.0.0.1`. It does not listen on any external interface — the API is reachable only from the same machine that runs the process. This is the primary network security boundary: there is no way to reach the API from another host.

## Per-launch token auth

Each backend launch is authenticated by a single token:

- The launcher accepts a `--token=<t>` CLI argument and stores it as the system property `fengyu.auth.token`.
- Every protected request must carry `X-FengYu-Token: <t>`.
- The token is regenerated per launch; there is no persisted credential. The desktop shell exposes it to the SPA via the `window.fengyu.token()` contextBridge snapshot before the page loads.

The combination of loopback binding and per-launch token keeps the API private to the local user even when the process is running.

## Layer responsibilities

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| [Backend](/en/architecture/backend) | REST/SSE surface, persistence, AI backends, plugin worker lifecycle, auth |
| [Frontend](/en/architecture/frontend) | Vue 3 SPA, Pinia stores, plugin UI mounting, setup wizard routing |
| [Desktop](/en/architecture/desktop) | Backend spawn/health/setup orchestration, contextBridge API, window + tray lifecycle |
| [Plugin System](/en/architecture/plugin-system) | `.fyp` package contract, out-of-process workers, sandboxed UI |

## Extension surfaces & the Agent

The Agent orchestrates three distinct surfaces, each isolated for a different reason:

- **Plugins (`.fyp`)** run **out-of-process** as JSON-RPC workers — a worker crash can never take down
  the host, and workers never touch the host Spring context or JPA session. Their UI is a sandboxed
  micro-frontend. See [Plugin System](/en/architecture/plugin-system).
- **Skills (`.fys`)** are progressive-disclosure packages: only their compact catalog sits in the
  system prompt, and the full body is loaded on demand via the built-in `skill` tool. See [Skills](/en/skills/).
- **AI tools** are in-process Spring AI `ToolCallback` beans the model calls directly during a chat.
  See [AI tools](/en/plugins/ai-tools).

For what the Agent can drive end-to-end, see the [Features](/en/features) capability matrix.

## Next steps

- [Backend](/en/architecture/backend) — `HeadlessLauncher`, SETUP/APP modes, and the token filter.
- [Desktop](/en/architecture/desktop) — how the Electron shell spawns and supervises the backend.
- [Quick Start](/en/quickstart) — build and run the three layers from source.
